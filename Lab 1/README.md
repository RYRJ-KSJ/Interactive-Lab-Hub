# Staging Interaction(Part 1)

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, I am going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)



## Part A. Plan 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Y loves trendy outfits but she always has a strong feeling of uncertainty on her daily look. So she bought a Magic Mirror several days ago.This Magic Mirror can tell her whether the look is perfect or not through change of colors. Y just needs to tap the Mirror slightly to wake it up. If the Mirror loves the look it will turn green, if not, it will turn yellow. Y can get comments from the Mirror easily. 

The Magic Mirror is a mirror that can be used simply as a mirror without tapping it. But if you knock its door it will shine lights of different colors to tell you its opinions.

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

yizhuo: It would be better if the mirror has at least 5 colors to show more accurate comments

kexin: The size of the Mirror can be a large one, so we can see the entire outfits clearly

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

Currently no.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

A smaller size mirror will be much more convenient then a full-length mirror in this setting, a huge mirror of bright lights is horrible.


## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

I was unable to run it on my mac and have not figured it out yet. Set-ups are great but cannot open it in browser.

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

I have a fragrance set box and many beauty stickers, so I used the sticker as the activation tab and the box as a container to put the actual mirror and cellphone to shine lights.


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*

Special thanks to my roommate to help me with the videos.



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

## Prep 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

Shen Hongyu: I would love to have a mirror like this! However my concern is that beauty is subjective; what if the user likes the outfit and the mirror does not?

Deng Kaiyuan: I love the idea that powering mirrors with the capability to communicate with users using different colors of light. As Yizhuo mentioned, having more colors can enable the mirror to show different kinds of comments. Different patterns of light can also be personalized by the users based on their dressing preferences.

Xiaotian Liu: The demo of the mirror is pretty cute! I would expect more colors to be applied. Also, I wonder how the mirror gives an assessment (will it take a pic or analyze the reflection of the image? Will there be privacy issues if the mirror takes the pic in my room? ) I may have commented a bit lot but trust me this is an amazing product that I love to see it goes real!

## Lab Overview

For this assignment, I am going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Prototype the device](#part-b-prototype-the-device)

C) [Costume the device](#part-c-costume-the-device)

D) [Record the interaction](#part-d-record)

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

## Part A. Plan

Y loves trendy outfits but she always has a strong feeling of uncertainty on her daily look. So she bought a Magic Mirror several days ago.This Magic Mirror can tell her whether the look is perfect or not through change of colors. Y just needs to tap the Mirror slightly to wake it up. If the Mirror really loves the look it will turn green, if not, it will turn yellow. And there are another 2 colors representing different opinions: blue for fit in style only, orange for fit in size only. Y can get comments from the Mirror easily. 

The Magic Mirror is a mirror that can be used simply as a mirror without tapping it. But if you knock it, it will shine lights of different colors to tell you its opinions. Also, you can set colors to stand for different opinions by yourself.
